# Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m * N integer matrix matrix.
# The matrix has the following properties:
# 1. integers in each row are sorted from left to right
# 2. the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

# Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
# Output: true
