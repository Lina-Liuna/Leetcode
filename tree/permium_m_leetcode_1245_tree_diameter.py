# Given an undirected tree, return its diameter: the number of edges in a longest path in that tree
# The tree is given as an array of edges where edges[i] = [u, v] is bidirectional edge
# between nodes u and v.
# Each node has labels in the set {0, 1, ...,edges.length}
Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
A longest path of the tree is the path 1 - 0 - 2.

Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: 4
Explanation:
A longest path of the tree is the path 3 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 5.
