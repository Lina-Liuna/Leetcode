# Given an integer array num of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range[1, n]
# and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

# You must write an aalgorithm that runs in o(n) time and uses only constant extra space.

# Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
# Output: [2,3]
